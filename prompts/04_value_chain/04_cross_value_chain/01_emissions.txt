You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the cross-value chain issue of emissions, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

---
### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for measures addressing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, or other releases associated with the plastic lifecycle.
- `details` (string): List specific emission-related measures mentioned, such as 'carbon footprint reduction', 'air pollution controls for production', 'incineration emission standards', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json
{
  "value_chain": {
    "cross_value_chain": {
      "emissions": {
        "mentioned": "boolean",
        "details": "string | null",
        "citation": [
          "string"
        ],
        "reasoning": "string | null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
