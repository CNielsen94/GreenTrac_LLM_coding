You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to implementation stringency, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

---
### Code Definitions
- `level` (string): Assess whether the document proposes a 'High' level of stringency (strict, legally binding, with enforcement), 'Low' (flexible, voluntary, or minimal enforcement), or is 'Not specified'.
- `details` (string): Describe enforcement or compliance measures mentioned, such as 'compliance committee', 'sanctions for non-compliance', 'binding obligations', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json
{
  "implementation": {
    "stringency": {
      "level": "string | null",
      "details": "string | null",
      "citation": [
        "string"
      ],
      "reasoning": "string | null"
    }
  }
}
```
