      ],
      "reasoning": "Although the document does not explicitly name 'NGOs' or 'civil society,' the terms 'relevant national stakeholders' and 'local organizations' are standard and inclusive terms for these groups in policy discussions. The citations assign them a consultative role in creating national plans and identify them as key groups whose capacity needs to be built to help implement policies, thus outlining their responsibilities within the treaty's framework."

      "details": "The document proposes the establishment of several international bodies and mechanisms to support the treaty's implementation. These include: a Conference of Parties to approve guidelines; a dedicated financial mechanism to provide financial resources and technical assistance; a scientific, technical and socio-economic assessment body; and an Implementation Committee to review compliance.",

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly calls for the creation and operation of international-level governance structures to ensure the treaty is effective. The cited texts describe specific roles for a Conference of Parties (approving guidelines), a financial mechanism (providing funds and assistance), and subsidiary bodies (scientific assessment and compliance review). These proposed entities are forms of international governance bodies whose responsibilities are clearly defined, matching the code definition."
