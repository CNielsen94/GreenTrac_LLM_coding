      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that the primary objective of the convention is to 'end plastic pollution'.

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document identifies specific health concerns related to plastic pollution, including the leaching of hazardous chemicals and additives into the human body, the ingestion and inhalation of microplastics, and pollution from unsafe waste disposal practices like open burning. It proposes that a scientific body investigate these issues to inform action and that capacity be built for hazard and risk assessments.",

        "The objectives of this convention are to end plastic pollution from all sources to protect the environment and minimise the risk to human health.",
        "While evidence on the harm to human health caused by plastic and plastic pollution is emerging, it is essential that the ETB, working closely with the WHO, makes a concerted effort to understand and resolve evidence gaps in the effects of plastic pollution on human health, so that the committee can take informed action to mitigate these risks.",
        "The UK proposes that the ETB focus on 3 key areas of the plastic life cycle where plastic production, use and disposal could negatively impact human health: - The regulatory testing of polymers and use of certain chemical additives, both during the use and disposal of plastic products, or any other stage where chemicals may leach into the human body or wider environment. - The presence of microplastics in the human body as a result of-ingestion and/or inhaling microplastics. - Pollution caused by unsafe disposal and waste management practices, such as open burning.",
        "We also recognize the importance of building the capacity to conduct hazard and risk assessments of chemicals of concern in developing countries, to protect against the potential risks to human health and the environment."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly establishes the protection of human health as a primary objective for the legally binding instrument. The citations show that this objective is supported by detailed proposals, including a call for an evidence-based approach to understand and mitigate specific health risks like chemical leaching and microplastic ingestion, and a focus on building capacity for health risk assessments. This demonstrates a clear and consistent emphasis on protecting human health throughout the submission."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states its objective is to 'protect the environment'. It demonstrates a clear marine focus by highlighting the need to address 'sea-based sources of plastic pollution' such as fishing gear, and references several marine-specific organizations and agreements (e.g., IMO, Regional Seas Conventions).

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly uses the terms 'whole lifecycle', 'entire plastics lifecycle', and 'full life cycle' to frame its proposed objectives and core obligations. The citations show that this concept is central to the UK's position, covering all stages from production and design through to consumption and disposal. The document further structures its proposed obligations into upstream (production) and downstream (waste management) stages, confirming a comprehensive, full lifecycle approach."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The cited text outlines specific socio-economic and procedural objectives that are not covered by the other categories. A 'just transition' is a social and economic equity goal focused on workers. The 'dedicated financial mechanism' and 'international cooperation' are enabling objectives that describe how the treaty will be implemented through financial support, capacity building, and collaborative research, rather than being direct environmental or health outcomes themselves."

The citations further detail these responsibilities across the product lifecycle, from upstream design considerations (design for recyclability, durability) and material inputs (use of recycled content) to downstream financial obligations for end-of-life waste management through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).
