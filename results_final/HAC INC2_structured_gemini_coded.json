      "details": "The document outlines several responsibilities for the production sector, including: adhering to product design criteria (durability, reusability, reparability, absence of substances of concern, recyclability); meeting targets for recycled content; providing information on product properties, chemical, and material composition (transparency); phasing out or restricting the production of harmful polymers, chemicals, and products; and participating in extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes.",

        "Measures could include extended producer responsibility schemes, deposit return schemes, or fees."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The cited texts directly assign obligations to the entities responsible for creating and selling plastic products. The quotes explicitly mention 'producers' and 'manufacturers' and their roles in 'production', 'manufacturing', and putting products 'on the market'. The responsibilities detailed, such as meeting design criteria, recycled content targets, providing information, and participating in extended producer responsibility schemes, are all core obligations for the production sector."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly states that there is a 'need' for 'users and consumers' to 'change consumption patterns' as a core part of the strategy to increase plastic circularity. This directly assigns a role and expected action to consumers in addressing plastic pollution."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly outlines obligations for Parties to ensure that plastic waste is managed in a specific manner. These obligations directly translate into responsibilities for the waste management sector, which is tasked with the collection, sorting, recycling, and final disposal of waste. The citations clearly define these responsibilities, including the need for environmentally sound practices, meeting quality standards for recycled materials, reducing landfilling, and remediating existing pollution."

The citations explicitly outline obligations for these Parties, using phrases like 'should be required to' and 'should set a target'. These obligations detail specific governmental responsibilities, including implementing regulatory measures, reporting data, setting national targets, managing waste, and engaging in international cooperation."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly outlines responsibilities for a 'Secretariat' and a 'Conference of Parties', which are standard governance bodies for an international legally binding instrument operating within the framework of international law, akin to the UN system. The citations show these bodies are tasked with specific functions such as establishing data registries and developing and adopting various technical and environmental guidelines, which directly aligns with the code definition of roles assigned to international bodies or treaty secretariats."
