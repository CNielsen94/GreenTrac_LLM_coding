      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly calls for the reduction of plastic production. It dedicates a section to a 'Provision to reduce production of primary plastic polymers' and outlines a general obligation for parties to 'reduce the production of plastics polymers'. It also suggests restricting the production of specific harmful polymers. This directly satisfies the code definition for 'mentioned'. However, the document does not provide any specific quantitative targets (e.g., percentages, caps, or timelines), instead stating that production should be reduced to 'an agreed level' and a 'common target' to be determined later. Therefore, 'specification_provided' is false."

It identifies significant adverse effects on human health caused by hazardous and toxic chemicals in plastics. Specific concerns mentioned include long-term toxic effects from substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic, or endocrine disruptors.

The citations further elaborate on this by identifying the mechanisms of harm (hazardous chemicals, toxic additives) and detailing specific health risks (carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic effects).

The document calls for measures to reduce and report on production, sets expectations for product design (e.g., for circularity, non-toxicity), proposes a financial obligation through an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system, and suggests a requirement for producers to register and disclose the materials they use. These points clearly define roles and obligations for the production sector."

The citations mandate the 'collected, sorted, and recycled' management of plastic waste, specify that 'final disposal operations' must not lead to environmental releases, and set targets for reducing 'landfilling and burning'.
