Specific health concerns mentioned include the 'significant adverse effects' of plastic pollution and the 'long term adverse effects' of certain polymers and chemicals. It details criteria for identifying harmful substances based on their toxic properties, explicitly listing effects such as being 'carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic, endocrine disruptors'. The goal is to create a circular economy for plastics that protects human health by eliminating and restricting these harmful substances.",

These are proposed to reduce the production of primary plastics, ensure sustainable product design, and manage recycling and final waste disposal. These financial instruments are a direct form of financing as defined by the code."

These responsibilities encompass product design standards, information transparency for downstream users and recyclers, and participation in policy mechanisms like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, clearly defining roles and obligations for the production sector in addressing plastic pollution."

This explicitly assigns a role and responsibility to consumers to alter their behavior.

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly outlines obligations for Parties to ensure that plastic waste is managed through specific actions like 'collected, sorted and recycled', 'disposed of', and remediation of 'legacy waste'. These are core functions of the waste management sector. The citations detail responsibilities across the entire waste hierarchy, from ensuring quality recycled materials are available for the market, to environmentally sound final disposal and cleaning up historical pollution."

In the context of an international legally binding instrument, a 'Party' refers to a signatory national government. The citations list specific obligations and roles for these governments, such as implementing policies, enforcing restrictions, reporting data, and overseeing waste management, which directly aligns with the code definition of government responsibilities."
