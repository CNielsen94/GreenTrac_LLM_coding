        "To close this pollution gap and implement the objective of ending plastic pollution, we must make significant investments in environmentally safe and sound waste management infrastructure, especially in Africa and other developing countries; and we must also eliminate legacy plastic pollution, which is an important source of ongoing pollution.",

      "reasoning": "The document's primary and explicitly stated goal, mentioned in the title and repeated throughout the summary, introduction, and conclusion, is to 'end plastic pollution' through a legally binding instrument. The proposed Global Plastic Pollution Fee is presented as a key mechanism to achieve this objective. However, the document does not specify any target year or timeline for when this goal should be accomplished."

It frames this reduction in supply and demand as a necessary component to end plastic pollution. While the goal of reducing production is clearly mentioned, the document does not provide any specific quantitative targets, caps, or percentage reductions, thus 'specification_provided' is false."
