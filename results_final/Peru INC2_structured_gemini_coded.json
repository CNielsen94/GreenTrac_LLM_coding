The citations mention keeping the supply of primary polymers at sustainable levels, reducing the production of certain polymers, restricting the production of single-use plastics, and establishing obligations for parties to reduce production. This confirms that the reduction of production is a mentioned objective. However, the document does not provide any specific quantitative targets (e.g., a percentage or a baseline year), instead stating that a level should be 'agreed in the present Instrument', thus no specification is provided."

The first citation includes 'tariffs' (a form of tax on trade) and the 'elimination of negative fiscal incentives, such as subsidies' (a fiscal policy measure). The second citation proposes 'Fees levied on plastic products', which is another form of taxation used to generate revenue and discourage the use of certain products. These all fall under the definition of tax incentives or related fiscal instruments."

Tariffs are a form of financial penalty or disincentive applied to discourage certain economic activities. Additionally, the mention of 'fees levied on plastic products' aligns with the concept of a punitive financial measure, as it increases the cost associated with plastic products, consistent with the polluter-pays principle."

This demonstrates a clear focus on holding the production sector accountable."

This directly indicates a role for the general public in managing their use of plastics. Furthermore, the suggestion to develop campaigns like beach clean-ups implies public participation and action."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly outlines several responsibilities for handling plastic after consumer use. The citations propose measures to improve recycling, collection, and overall waste management systems, including the proper disposal of residual waste. They also highlight the need to set national recycling targets and formally integrate waste pickers, who are a critical part of the informal waste management sector, into national strategies. These points directly assign roles and obligations to entities responsible for waste management."
