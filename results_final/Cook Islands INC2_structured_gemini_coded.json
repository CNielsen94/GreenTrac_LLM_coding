      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that the primary objective of the proposed instrument is to 'end plastic pollution.'

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly calls for the reduction of plastic production. It advocates for a 'reduction in the overall production', 'provisions to phase out the production', and requires parties to 'not allow the production' of certain plastics. It also proposes that national targets must include the 'reduction in production and consumption of plastic polymers'. While it calls for setting targets, it does not provide any specific quantitative figures, hence 'specification_provided' is false."

      "reasoning": "The document acknowledges that some uses of plastics are necessary or essential by calling for a process of 'specific exemptions' for certain applications. While it doesn't list the specific benefits (e.g., medical uses), the need to justify exemptions inherently recognizes that some plastics provide a utility that cannot be immediately phased out."

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document explicitly states that a primary objective is to protect human health from the impacts of plastics throughout their full lifecycle.

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that a primary objective is 'Protecting the environment' from plastic pollution. It demonstrates a clear marine focus by highlighting the need to safeguard 'the marine environment'. The goal of biodiversity protection is further solidified by references to the 'sustainable conservation of ecosystems' and a direct citation from the 'Convention for Biological Diversity' which mentions the 'conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity'."

Chemical phase [otherwise referred to as ‘upstream']— production and chemical processing of polymer, commodity, and speciality chemicals 3. Material phase [otherwise referred to as 'midstream'] – manufacturing of materials and final products, and consumption by retailers, transporters, and consumers 4. Dematerialization phase [otherwise referred to as ‘downstream'] – waste management and final treatment by waste facilities 5. Leakage phase – legacy pollution and remediation"

      "reasoning": "The document repeatedly and explicitly calls for addressing plastics across their 'full life cycle'. It not only uses this exact terminology but also provides a detailed, five-phase definition of the lifecycle, covering every stage from raw material extraction ('sourcing/extraction phase') through production, use, waste management ('dematerialization phase'), and even legacy pollution ('leakage phase'). This comprehensive breakdown confirms the coverage is for the full lifecycle."

The first citation details an objective focused on international cooperation, capacity building, and financial/technical support for developing nations.

Eliminating a subsidy is a fiscal measure that removes a financial incentive, functioning similarly to a tax by increasing the cost of production. This aligns with the code definition which covers 'tax-related measures' and 'similar fiscal measures'."

        "reasoning": "The cited texts directly support the finding by explicitly mentioning the need to establish a financial mechanism for 'transfer of technologies' and 'technology assistance'.

        ],
        "reasoning": "The document explicitly addresses the social impacts of the transition on vulnerable groups by calling for the protection of the rights of Pacific Islanders and Indigenous communities. It further reinforces this by advocating for the inclusion of their traditional knowledge and referencing the Paris Agreement's provision for considering 'vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems.' These elements are central to the concept of a just transition, which ensures that environmental policies do not disproportionately harm marginalized populations."

This is a direct call for a mandatory certification scheme. It also recommends a 'licensing scheme' for the production and trade of plastic polymers, which is another form of mandatory approval system.

The citations detail specific mandatory provisions that directly assign responsibility to producers, such as phasing out certain types of production, adhering to sustainable design criteria, managing production waste (pellets), and being subject to licensing and reporting schemes.
