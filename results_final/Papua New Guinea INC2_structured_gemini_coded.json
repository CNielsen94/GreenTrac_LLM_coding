This aligns with the code definition. However, the document does not specify a global target year or a concrete timeline for achieving this objective. It mentions that national plans should have a 'timeframe' and problematic plastics could be phased out 'within a certain timeframe', but these are general suggestions, not a specific end date for the overall goal."

      "reasoning": "The document, while overwhelmingly focused on the negative impacts of plastic pollution, implicitly acknowledges that not all plastics are equally harmful. By differentiating between 'problematic' plastics and those that are 'less problematic' or 'not so problematic', the text suggests that the use of some plastics should continue, albeit with improved standards and design.
