      ],
      "reasoning": "The document supports measures for the 'sustainable production and consumption of plastic' and acknowledges that the proposed actions 'could also drive down the demand for plastic.' This indicates an intention to influence the production phase of the plastic lifecycle, which is distinct from post-consumer waste management. However, the document does not provide any specific quantitative targets, caps, or timelines for reducing production."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly acknowledges the positive aspects of plastics while discussing potential elements for the preamble of the international instrument.

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document specifies that the instrument's objective should focus on the protection of human health from plastic pollution.

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that a core objective is the 'protection of... the environment from plastic pollution.' It specifically mentions the impact on 'the marine environment' multiple times and also clarifies that the scope includes 'terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems,' confirming both a general environmental protection goal and a specific focus on marine ecosystems."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The document frequently and explicitly refers to a 'lifecycle' approach for addressing plastic pollution. It specifically uses the term 'full lifecycle', indicating a comprehensive scope. Furthermore, it details actions across all key stages, including 'sustainable production and consumption' and 'environmentally sound management of plastic waste,' which validates the 'Full lifecycle' coverage determination."

        "reasoning": "The document explicitly proposes 'Public procurement policies' as a potential area for obligations and commitments within the international instrument. It specifies that these policies can be used to prevent and reduce plastic waste and to drive demand for products containing higher recycled content.

The first quote, listed under potential obligations, explicitly mentions measures to 'foster innovation and incentivize' research and development in sustainable chemistry and alternatives.

The citations explicitly mention the need to mitigate risks to livelihoods resulting from the transition to a circular plastics economy and to address the disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities. Furthermore, the specific inclusion of 'informal waste workers' as a key stakeholder group provides clear evidence that the social impacts of the transition on vulnerable populations are being considered."

The document explicitly calls for measures that 'enable informed consumer choices,' promotes 'consumer behavior change campaigns,' and advocates for education to help consumers 'make better decisions about plastic use and disposal.'

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly identifies 'strengthen[ing] the environmentally sound management of plastic waste' and facilitating 'environmentally sound plastic scrap recycling' as key areas for obligations and commitments within the proposed international instrument. These are core responsibilities of the waste management and recycling sectors. Furthermore, the text suggests national action plans will include improving 'the management of plastic waste' and implementing programs to 'incentivize recycling and reuse,' which directly involve and assign roles to entities handling post-consumer materials."
