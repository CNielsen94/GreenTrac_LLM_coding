      "reasoning": "The cited texts explicitly assign roles to 'international organization[s]' for strengthening efforts and facilitating the sharing of information and best practices. Furthermore, the proposal to establish a 'secretariat or commission' directly points to a core function of the UN system or a similar international body responsible for coordinating the implementation of a global instrument. This fulfills the code's definition of assigning roles or responsibilities to such entities."
