      "reasoning": "The document does not explicitly state that plastics are beneficial. However, it implicitly acknowledges their utility and necessity by identifying several key sectors, most notably 'Healthcare', as having 'unique considerations' that require 'dedicated programmes and strategies'. This suggests a recognition that the role of plastics in these sectors is essential and complex, warranting a specialized approach rather than a straightforward prohibition, thereby acknowledging their necessary function in these contexts."

It further elaborates on this by recommending measures to minimize 'health impacts' from raw material production and by identifying specific health-related criteria, such as toxicity (carcinogenic, reprotoxic, endocrine disruptors), for regulating chemicals and polymers.

These include promoting a 'circular economy' as a distinct economic model, ensuring a 'just transition' as a specific socio-economic equity goal, fostering 'international cooperation' as a procedural objective, and upholding 'human rights' as a foundational goal, which is broader than the specific objective of protecting human health from plastics."
