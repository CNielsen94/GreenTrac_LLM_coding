It refers to the development of an instrument 'to end plastic pollution', aligns its national measures with the 'global aim to end plastic pollution', and supports an objective with the 'ultimate goal to end plastic pollution'. However, no specific timeframe for the actual elimination of plastic pollution is provided. The mention of 'by 2024' refers to the timeline for developing the international instrument, not for achieving the goal of ending plastic pollution itself."
