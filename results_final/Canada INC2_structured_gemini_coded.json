      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly proposes measures to control the types of plastics being produced by suggesting parties should \"eliminate or restrict unnecessary and problematic plastic products\". This action directly aligns with the code's definition of controlling or restricting plastic production, even though it does not mention a reduction in the overall volume of all plastic production."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The document acknowledges the benefits and utility of plastics by implication. It consistently focuses on eliminating \"unnecessary and problematic\" plastics, which logically suggests that some plastics are considered necessary and non-problematic. Furthermore, the text explicitly mentions the goal to \"recirculate the value of needed plastics in the economy,\" directly recognizing that certain plastics have essential value and are needed to continue circulating within the economy."

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document explicitly states that a primary objective of the legally binding instrument is to protect human health from the adverse impacts of plastic pollution.

      ],
      "reasoning": "The document repeatedly and explicitly identifies the protection of human health as a core driver and objective for the international instrument. The citations show this is not a passing mention, but a central theme, from the main proposed objective to the specific criteria for identifying problematic plastics and the call for scientific research on health impacts."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states an objective to 'protect human health and the environment' from plastic pollution. It further elaborates that managing plastics will help 'conserve nature and biodiversity.' The focus on marine ecosystems is evident through specific references to eliminating 'the discharge of litter into the oceans' and the need to 'mitigate and remediate plastic pollution, including in the marine environment,' confirming a distinct marine focus."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states the need for 'action across the entire lifecycle of plastics' and 'solutions spanning the plastics lifecycle.' It further elaborates on this by outlining provisions that cover all stages: production (eliminating problematic products), use (sustainable consumption and circular design), and end-of-life (sustainable management and remediation), which justifies the coding of 'Full lifecycle' coverage."

These include promoting a 'circular economy' (a specific economic model for resource management), ensuring a 'just and inclusive transition' (a socio-economic goal focused on the welfare of workers and communities), and establishing mechanisms for 'international cooperation' and 'accountability' (procedural goals to ensure the instrument's effectiveness)."

        ],
        "reasoning": "The document explicitly lists 'extended producer responsibility programs' as a potential measure for Parties to implement.

The cited texts mention 'minimum recycled content requirements,' 'design or production principles, requirements, or additional standards or certifications,' and 'circularity criteria,' all of which are regulations that products must meet to enhance circularity and sustainability, directly matching the code definition."

These systems inherently require physical infrastructure. Furthermore, the requirement for National Action Plans to assess and report on 'management infrastructure and systems' confirms that the development and maintenance of such infrastructure is a core component of the proposed instrument's implementation."

        "The objective builds upon the collective recognition by the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) to end plastic pollution, as well as the importance of long-term elimination of the discharge of litter into the oceans and avoiding its detriment to ecosystems and the human activities dependent on them, as per UNEA resolutions 5/14 and 4/6 (reiteration of 3/7), respectively.",
        "The Conference of the Parties, or a mechanism within it, should develop guidance to: (a) prevent and reduce plastics entering the environment from key sources and pathways; and, (b) prioritize and conduct environmentally sound removal of plastic pollution on land and from waterways and nearshore areas, as well as open water removal of abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear within national jurisdictions.",
        "The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) adopted Resolution 5/14, which called for provisions to specify arrangements for capacity-building and technical assistance, technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, and financial assistance.",
        "Also noting that document UNEP/PP/INC.1/5 covers in passing these elements, it is recommended that the intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) Secretariat provide more detailed information to Member States on options for means of implementation, taking into consideration lessons learned from other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), to support treaty development at INC-2."

      "reasoning": "The cited texts explicitly name various UN bodies and associated mechanisms (UNEA, UNEP, Conference of the Parties, INC Secretariat) and assign them specific roles and responsibilities. These include setting the foundational objective, developing official guidance for parties, mandating the inclusion of certain provisions in the treaty, and providing informational support to member states during the negotiation process."
