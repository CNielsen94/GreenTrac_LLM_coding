      "reasoning": "The document assigns an indirect responsibility to consumers by identifying them as the target for key implementation measures. The citations show that National Action Plans, a core tool of the proposed instrument, are expected to include programs designed to foster 'behavioral change' and 'regulate consumption patterns' among the public, which are key consumer responsibilities in addressing plastic pollution."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly lists 'Sustainable waste management' as a core global action and the 'Development of a comprehensive and environmentally sound and sustainable waste management infrastructure' as a key implementation measure for states to consider in their National Action Plans.

      "reasoning": "The cited text explicitly names the 'informal plastics waste sector' and 'waste pickers' as stakeholders whose actions should be part of the measures considered in developing National Action Plans (NAPs).
