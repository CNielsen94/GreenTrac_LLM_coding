This aligns with the code definition which includes looking for statements about addressing or tackling plastic pollution as a primary goal. However, the document does not specify any overarching date or timeline for achieving this objective."

      "reasoning": "The document mentions reducing plastic production within the context of 'voluntary approaches'. It explicitly lists the option to 'Restrict or ban the production' of certain products and suggests using economic tools 'to reduce production'. This directly satisfies the code definition for mentioning production reduction. However, it does not provide any specific quantitative targets or caps, hence no specifications are provided."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that a key objective is to protect the environment. It directly identifies that leaked plastics have a \"long-term adverse impact on global soil and aquatic environment and biodiversity.\" While the focus is broad, including terrestrial environments (\"soil\"), it specifically highlights the marine impact by citing a UNEP document stating that plastic waste has contaminated the \"entire marine environment,\" justifying the marine focus."

Furthermore, it explicitly aims to 'Support closed-loop systems,' a specific circular economy principle that is a separate objective from the broader lifecycle approach."

A tax functions as a punitive financial measure to discourage the use of certain products, which aligns with the code definition.
