      "details": "Engagement in multi-stakeholder processes through forums, submissions, seminars, and side events; participation in a proposed technical expert group to ensure proactive involvement.",

        "The group should consist of experts, scientists, academia and other stakeholders such as industry sectors.",
        "In this sense, Japan supports the process of engagement by stakeholders including governments, scientists, civil societies through multi-stakeholder forums, submissions, seminars and side events as well as the participation to an abovementioned expert group to seek their proactive involvement."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly identifies 'civil societies' as a key stakeholder group. It then outlines their responsibilities in the process, which include active participation in forums, making submissions, and potentially joining a technical expert group. This assigns them a clear role in contributing to the international instrument."

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document assigns a role to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), a UN-convened body, to utilize recommendations from a proposed expert group for developing the instrument's definitions, standards, and criteria. It also acknowledges the role of existing scientific bodies under UN-administered treaties (like the Stockholm Convention) and advises against duplicating their work.",
      "citation": [
        "The recommendations could be utilized by INC to consider definition, standards and criteria in the instrument.",
        "It is necessary to consider how such fields relate to the instrument in order to determine the most appropriate system for accumulating said field of knowledge and how to conduct its assessment, while avoiding duplication with existing scientific bodies under relevant treaties, e.g. the Stockholm Convention and its POPRC."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The text directly refers to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), which is the UN-mandated body responsible for developing the treaty. The document states the INC should use recommendations from an expert group, thereby assigning it a specific responsibility in the treaty development process. Furthermore, by referencing the need to avoid duplication with bodies under treaties like the Stockholm Convention (whose secretariat is administered by UNEP), the document acknowledges the existing roles and responsibilities of the broader UN system in international environmental governance."
