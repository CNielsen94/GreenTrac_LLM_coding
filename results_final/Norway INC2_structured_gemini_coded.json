      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that the proposed objective is 'To end plastic pollution' and refers to 'ending plastic pollution as the ultimate goal of the Treaty'.

It suggests a 'General Obligation' for each party to 'take effective measures to reduce the production of primary plastics polymers'. However, the document does not specify any quantitative targets (e.g., percentages, specific caps), instead referring to future goals like 'an agreed level' and 'a common target', thus specification is not provided."

This approach suggests that plastic use in these sectors is essential and requires a nuanced management strategy to address pollution, rather than outright elimination."

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document explicitly states that a primary objective of the treaty is to protect human health from plastic pollution. It details specific health concerns, including the long-term adverse effects of chemicals used in plastics such as softeners, stabilisers, and colourants. It identifies categories of hazardous substances to be eliminated or restricted, including carcinogens, mutagens, reprotoxic substances, endocrine disruptors, immunotoxicants, and neurotoxicants.

      "reasoning": "The document's proposed objective explicitly includes protecting human health. It goes into significant detail about the mechanisms for achieving this, such as eliminating specific chemicals and polymers known to have long-term adverse effects on human health (e.g., carcinogens, neurotoxicants). It also proposes ongoing monitoring of health impacts, directly aligning with the code's definition of preserving, protecting, or addressing risks to human health from plastic pollution."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that ending plastic pollution is motivated by its 'devastating impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity,' directly confirming the objective of protecting them. A specific marine focus is evident through dedicated measures targeting the 'loss of fishing gear'—a well-known threat to marine wildlife and ecosystems—and the identification of 'marine coatings' as a source of microplastic pollution."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that National Action Plans should address the 'full life cycle of plastics'. This comprehensive approach is further demonstrated by the structure of the proposed core obligations, which cover every stage from the reduction of primary polymer production, through product design and circularity (reuse, recycling), to waste management, final disposal, and remediation of legacy waste. The citation of a scientific article advocating for an agreement to 'address the life cycle of plastics' further reinforces this foundational concept."

      "reasoning": "The document outlines several distinct objectives beyond the excluded categories. These include: promoting a circular economy as a systemic goal for sustainable management; establishing a framework for international cooperation and coordination as a governance objective; providing financial and technical assistance as an enabling mechanism for implementation, particularly for developing countries; and ensuring a just transition, which is a socio-economic objective focused on fairness for affected workers and communities."

The cited texts list 'taxes', 'tariffs', 'fees', 'tax incentives', and specific 'landfill and incineration taxes' as tools to reduce plastic production, encourage reuse, manage waste, and mobilize resources. The mention of removing 'negative fiscal incentives' and restructuring 'taxation' further confirms the relevance of this code."

'Production permits' are a core component of cap-and-trade systems. The mention of removing 'trade barriers' and using 'trade incentives' further confirms that trade-based economic instruments are being considered as potential measures to control plastic pollution."
