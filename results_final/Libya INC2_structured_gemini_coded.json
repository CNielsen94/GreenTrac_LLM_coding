      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that the primary objective of the treaty is the 'long-term elimination of plastic pollution'. It consistently refers to 'addressing plastic pollution' and developing policies to 'eliminate plastic pollution', which directly matches the code definition. However, no specific year or measurable timeline for achieving this goal is mentioned in the text."

It directly states the need to 'Phase out the production... of toxic plastic products' and for 'Controlling production... of plastics containing toxic chemicals'. Additionally, it proposes an upstream control measure by 'Controlling the export and import of raw materials for single-use plastic products,' which is a direct method to limit manufacturing."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly mentions the need for a 'full life cycle' approach. It grounds this concept by structuring its proposed measures across distinct phases, including production ('Drying up the sources'), use ('Circulation'), and end-of-life ('Improve waste management'), clearly demonstrating an intent to cover the entire lifecycle of plastics from creation to disposal."

      "reasoning": "The document outlines several objectives that are distinct from the excluded categories. These objectives focus on the economic model (promoting a circular economy), the principles of implementation (equity for all countries, stakeholder inclusivity, and support for developing nations), and the governance mechanisms of the treaty itself (harmonized monitoring, transparent national action plans). These are procedural, economic, and implementation-focused goals, rather than direct environmental or health outcomes."
