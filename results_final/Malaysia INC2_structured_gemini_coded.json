      "reasoning": "The document explicitly uses the phrase 'ending plastic pollution' and 'addressing plastic pollution' multiple times. The proposed objective clearly states the instrument's goal is the 'prevention, reduction and better management of plastic waste' to counter the impact of plastic pollution. This directly matches the code definition. The document does not specify any target year or timeline for achieving this goal."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly acknowledges the positive economic contributions of plastics, stating that pollution control measures should be implemented 'without hampering the economic benefits of plastics'.

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that a core objective should be to protect the environment.

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly uses phrases such as \"whole life cycle approach,\" \"entire lifecycle of plastics,\" and \"full life-cycle approach.\" These citations clearly indicate that the scope of the proposed measures is intended to cover all stages of the plastic lifecycle, from production through to waste management, justifying the 'Full lifecycle' coverage determination."

      "reasoning": "The document outlines several distinct policy objectives that are not covered by the other specified categories. These include establishing a specific economic model (a circular economy), fostering international scientific and technological collaboration, and creating a financial and social support system to ensure an equitable transition for developing countries and workers in the informal sector. These are specific economic, collaborative, and socio-economic goals that stand apart from the general aims of ending pollution or protecting health/biodiversity."

        "reasoning": "The document explicitly calls for a 'dedicated multilateral fund' to provide 'stable and predictable financing'. A fund that distributes financial resources to support the implementation of an international agreement falls under the code's definition of 'financial support' and is a form of economic instrument akin to a subsidy or grant system."

Furthermore, it specifically mentions the need to consider solutions across 'all sectors, both formal and informal,' which directly addresses the social impact on vulnerable groups like informal waste pickers. The proposed establishment of a 'socio-economic advisory panel' and mechanisms for 'socioeconomic assessment' further confirm the intention to address the social dimensions of the plastic transition, aligning with the code's definition."
