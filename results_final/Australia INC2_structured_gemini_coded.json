      "reasoning": "The document explicitly assigns responsibilities to the downstream, post-consumer stage of the plastic lifecycle. The cited texts clearly articulate obligations for the waste management sector, including the environmentally sound management of plastic waste (especially non-recyclables), the regulation of end-of-life processes to prevent leakage, the management of existing pollution, and the provision of necessary services and technology."

This demonstrates a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities to the UN system and related international governance bodies."
