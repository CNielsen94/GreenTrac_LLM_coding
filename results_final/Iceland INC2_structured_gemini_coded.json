It also notes that increasing circularity would 'reduce the demand for primary production of plastics'. These points directly align with the code definition of controlling or reducing plastic production. However, no specific quantitative targets (e.g., percentage reductions, caps) are mentioned, so 'specification_provided' is false."

It specifies the goal of creating a 'circular economy' and promoting 'sustainable production and consumption patterns,' which are specific systemic and economic models for managing resources. These go beyond just a 'lifecycle approach' by prescribing a particular system. Additionally, the text explicitly states the objective of establishing 'international cooperation' with financial and technical support, which is a procedural and enabling goal focused on the successful implementation of the treaty rather than the direct management of plastics."
