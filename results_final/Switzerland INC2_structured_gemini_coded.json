      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly dedicates a section to provisions aimed at reducing the production of primary plastic polymers. It proposes a general obligation for parties to limit the manufacture of these materials, clearly indicating an objective to control plastic production at its source. While it mentions concepts like 'global caps' and limiting production to an 'agreed level', it does not provide a specific, quantifiable target."

      "benefits_listed": null,
      "citation": [
        "As a result, when the use of plastics cannot be eliminated, an important way to reduce waste generation and plastic pollution is to keep plastic materials in the economy for as long as possible by extending their lifespan, and enabling reuse, repair, and eliminate unnecessary plastics."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The document, while overwhelmingly focused on the negative impacts of plastics, implicitly acknowledges their utility by stating 'when the use of plastics cannot be eliminated'. This phrase concedes that some uses of plastic are necessary or essential, directly aligning with the code's definition of acknowledging plastic's utility or necessity in certain contexts, even though no specific benefits are listed."

    "protect_human_health": {
      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document specifies that the objective is to protect human health from the adverse impacts of plastics. This includes addressing polymers and chemicals of concern that are harmful to human health, leading to bioaccumulation and toxic long-term effects such as being carcinogenic, reprotoxic, or endocrine disruptors. Specific examples cited are phthalates, bisphenols, and toxic metals like lead and cadmium.",

        "Each Party should be required to ensure that the public has access to information about plastics and related pollution and adverse effects on human health, and that the information is kept up-to-date..."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that protecting human health is a primary objective of the proposed convention. It provides specific examples of health risks, such as exposure to carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in plastics, and identifies these as criteria for phasing out certain materials. Furthermore, it suggests implementation measures like public information campaigns on the adverse health effects of plastic pollution."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that a core objective is to 'protect the environment' and lists 'biodiversity' as a key principle to guide the instrument's implementation. The mention of remediating 'aquatic environments' and legacy waste in 'oceans' confirms a specific focus on marine ecosystems in addition to terrestrial ones."

        "The instrument should therefore contain provisions that address all stages of the lifecycle of plastics, and include obligations and control measures in each of the stages.",
        "Life cycle assessments should complement guidance on the ecological impact of plastics and alternative materials."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly mentions the need for a 'lifecycle' approach, using phrases like 'entire lifecycle of plastics' and 'full lifecycle of plastics'. The citations confirm that the proposed instrument is intended to be comprehensive, covering all stages from production to end-of-life. The document's structure, which outlines provisions from reducing polymer supply to waste management and remediation, further supports the conclusion of 'Full lifecycle' coverage."

        "An additional goal is to foster international cooperation and transparency, requiring standardized reporting and data sharing on plastic production, use, and disposal."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states several objectives that are not covered by the other categories. These are distinct policy goals focused on the mechanisms of the treaty's implementation: 1) establishing producer responsibility, 2) providing financial and technical assistance to ensure equitable participation, and 3) creating systems for international cooperation and transparent reporting. These are procedural and structural objectives, rather than the thematic environmental or health outcomes defined in the other codes."

          "The instrument should also provide incentives to drive public and private investments to support the objective of the instrument: to protect the environment and human health, and end plastic pollution."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The document explicitly lists 'removal of fiscal incentives' as a potential measure to limit the supply of primary plastic polymers. Fiscal incentives are a form of subsidy. Additionally, it suggests providing 'incentives' to encourage public and private investment, which falls under the definition of subsidies as a financial incentive."
