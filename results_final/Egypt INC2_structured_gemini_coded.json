      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document outlines several responsibilities for the waste management sector, including: promoting environmentally sound management (ESM) of plastic waste; enhancing collection, recycling, and final treatment; controlling toxic emissions from mismanagement practices like open burning; strengthening the plastic recycling market; and providing support to the informal waste sector. It also suggests a system where waste collectors and processors would document and record recycled quantities.",

        "Promotion of periodical upgraded environmentally sound management (ESM) of plastic waste in line with resource efficiency and dedicating adequate financial resources and technologies to enhance collection, recycling and final treatment of waste.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly details core obligations for the \"Downstream phase: Waste Management and Remediation\". The citations directly list actions and promotional policies aimed at entities responsible for handling plastic waste post-consumption. These actions range from high-level management principles (ESM) and market development to specific operational tasks (enhancing collection, controlling emissions, documenting recycled quantities), clearly defining the expected roles and obligations of the waste management sector."

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document specifies roles and needs for the informal sector, including: a just transition to sustainable livelihoods for waste recyclers and waste pickers in informal settings; financial and technical support for the informal sector's role in waste management and recycling; and the transfer of resources and skills to informal micro, small, and medium enterprises involved in recycling projects.",
      "citation": [

      ],
      "reasoning": "The document explicitly and repeatedly mentions the informal sector, including 'waste recyclers, in both formal and informal settings,' 'waste pickers,' 'affected informal waste workers,' and 'informal micro, small and medium enterprises.' The citations clearly outline a need to provide this sector with financial and technical support, ensure a just transition for its workers, and recognize its significant role in waste management and recycling, thereby justifying the coding decision."

      "mentioned": true,
      "details": "The document outlines numerous government responsibilities, including: developing and implementing mandatory National Action Plans; phasing down the production, consumption, and trade of certain plastics; establishing control measures and standards for product design; promoting policies for environmentally sound waste management; monitoring, reporting, and evaluating progress on a national and global level; investing in research and innovation; conducting public awareness campaigns; and for developed countries, providing financial and technological support to developing nations.",

      "reasoning": "The document is a national submission outlining a proposed international treaty structure. The term 'parties' consistently refers to national governments that would sign the treaty. The citations are direct proposals for obligations that these governments would undertake, such as creating mandatory action plans, establishing regulatory mechanisms to phase down production, conducting monitoring, promoting specific waste management policies, and contributing to financial mechanisms. These are all core responsibilities of government bodies in the context of an international environmental agreement."

      "reasoning": "The document explicitly states that National Action Plans should be developed in consultation with 'relevant stakeholders'. In the context of international environmental policy and national implementation, 'relevant stakeholders' is a standard and inclusive term that encompasses non-governmental organizations, civil society, and advocacy groups. This assigns them a specific consultative role in the national planning process."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly outlines responsibilities for the 'secretariat of the instrument,' a key entity within the international governance framework often managed by the UN system. These responsibilities include identifying technology needs based on national documents. Additionally, the proposal to create subsidiary scientific and implementation committees, typical of multilateral environmental agreements, further defines the roles of the international governance structure."
