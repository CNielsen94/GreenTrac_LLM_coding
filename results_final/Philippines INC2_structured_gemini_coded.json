The citations mention a 'ban on... irresponsible plastic production,' the phasing out of the 'production and use of polymers,' the 'manufacturing... of plastic products that will be subjects of bans,' and the ultimate 'termination/abolition of its productions.' These statements clearly support the code's focus on controlling the upstream manufacturing of plastic, distinct from downstream waste management. However, the document does not provide any specific quantitative targets, such as percentage reductions or production caps, only suggesting that such measures should be 'planned time-bound' and listed in a future Annex."
