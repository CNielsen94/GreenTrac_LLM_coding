It explicitly states that discussions on detailed implementation (which would include compliance and enforcement) are premature. The support mechanisms mentioned are facilitative (capacity building, information sharing) rather than enforcement-based (e.g., sanctions, compliance committees), indicating a preference for a low-stringency, cooperative framework."
