- **LLM Justification (from underlying codes):**
> **For `AP : 1. Collection, sorting and waste management`:**
> **Reasoning:** The document explicitly addresses waste management in a dedicated subsection, calling for policies and measures to handle plastic waste after it has been used. The cited texts list specific downstream waste management activities such as separate collection, recycling, and restrictions on landfilling and dumping, directly matching the code's definition. The topic is further reinforced as a necessary implementation action and a target for financial support.
> **Citations:**
> - In addition to reducing virgin plastic production and promoting a circular economy through means such as improved product design and use, policies and measures will also be needed to promote the environmentally sound management of plastic waste, in particular separate collection and recycling, prevention of leakage and restrictions on dumping, landfilling, etc.
> - Actions to reduce plastics use and manage plastic waste, including emissions
> - ...the success of the treaty will require the provision of necessary means of implementation for small island developing States (SIDS), least developed countries (LDCS) and other vulnerable countries, including for any core obligations, along with support for enabling and monitoring and reporting activities, addressing barriers to recycling, and developing sustainable alternatives.

> **For `AR : 3. Legacy plastic`:**
> **Reasoning:** The document explicitly and repeatedly mentions the need to address plastic pollution that is already in the environment. The cited texts use key phrases like 'remediating existing plastic pollution' and 'address the legacy plastic pollution that already exists in the environment,' which directly match the code's definition of cleaning up already-polluted areas. This is identified as a primary objective, a core obligation under its own 'Remediation' heading, and a required implementation action.
> **Citations:**
> - To end plastic pollution in all global environments, including by limiting production and consumption of plastics to sustainable levels and products; promoting a circular economy for plastics, and; remediating existing plastic pollution where possible, particularly in the marine environment.
> - Policies and measures must also be put into place to address the legacy plastic pollution that already exists in the environment, prioritizing those locations and pollutants that cause the most harmful impacts on human health and ecosystems, with particular attention to existing plastic pollution in the marine environment (including in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction) and focusing especially on small islands/atolls.

> The document lists 'Tax on certain types of plastic products' as a potential voluntary approach for countries. A tax functions as a punitive financial measure to discourage the use of certain products, which aligns with the code definition. However, it is crucial to note that the document also explicitly states the international compliance mechanism should be 'non-punitive', indicating that such measures are envisioned as national-level policy tools rather than international enforcement penalties.
- **LLM Citations:**
> - Tax on certain types of plastic products;

> The document explicitly mentions the 'polluter-pays-principle', which is a core concept for financial penalties. It also provides concrete examples of punitive economic instruments, such as 'landfill taxes and incineration taxes' designed to discourage undesirable waste management practices, and 'eco-modulated fees' which financially penalize producers for less sustainable product design. These citations directly align with the code definition of financial penalties and fees for non-compliance with environmental goals.
- **LLM Citations:**
> - Economic incentives to move management of plastic waste further up the waste hierarchy, e.g., minimum landfill taxes and incineration taxes
> - The EU and its Member States stress the need for having provisions that follow the polluter-pays-principle and that ensure the mainstreaming of relevant measures to end plastic pollution into national policy.
> - The guidelines could specify the essential minimum requirements to be included in such schemes. These could include the minimal cost that are covered by the producers... the use of eco-modulated fees and others.

> The document explicitly lists 'tariffs' as a potential mandatory measure to reduce the production of plastics. Tariffs are a form of financial penalty or disincentive applied to discourage certain economic activities. Additionally, the mention of 'fees levied on plastic products' aligns with the concept of a punitive financial measure, as it increases the cost associated with plastic products, consistent with the polluter-pays principle.
- **LLM Citations:**
> - Measures could include, inter alia: tariffs, production permits and licences, moratoria, bans, regulations and the elimination of negative fiscal incentives, such as subsidies that support the expansion of plastics production.
> - Fees levied on plastic products, which serve as a source of funding to implement national/regional plans and/or technological innovation and awareness-raising projects.

The cited texts mention 'taxes and fees for consumption reduction', a 'disincentive' on certain products, a specific 'tax for certain types of plastics', and legal recourse through 'civil action for failure to abide' with national plans. These all directly align with the code's definition of financial penalties, fines, or fees for non-compliance.
- **LLM Citations:**
> - Control Measures is through a planned time-bound (phase- out/phase-down) reduction as well as market-based instruments such as taxes and fees for consumption reduction.
> - Disincentive/ ban on particular plastic products and applications that constitute an excessive risk of plastic pollution and/or particular harm to the environment, such as single use plastics and irresponsible plastic production.
> - Imposition of tax for certain types of plastics especially those that release harmful chemicals to the environment.

#### 📍 Country: Sierra Leone
- **LLM Coded:** `1`
- **NVIVO Coded:** `0`

- **LLM Citations:**
> - Introduction of a levy on the private sector that will fund implementation and remediation
> - Additionally, to ensure the treaty's sustainability, a self-financing system should be established by implementing an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system at the national, regional, and international levels. This EPR system would place financial responsibility for the treatment and disposal of waste on the producers of the waste, thereby providing a steady stream of funding for the treaty's implementation and enforcement.

#### 📍 Country: Ghana
- **LLM Coded:** `1`
- **NVIVO Coded:** `0`
- **LLM Reasoning:**
> The document, while primarily focused on a global fee, explicitly mentions that this fee is intended to 'complement phase-out obligations.' A 'phase-out' is a gradual ban, which directly aligns with the code definition. This citation confirms that bans are considered a relevant and parallel regulatory instrument in the context of the legally binding instrument being discussed.
- **LLM Citations:**

#### 📍 Country: Australia
- **LLM Coded:** `1`
- **NVIVO Coded:** `0`
- **LLM Reasoning:**
> The document explicitly mentions the 'polluter-pays principle', which is the foundational concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). This principle assigns responsibility for the environmental impacts and end-of-life management of a product to its producer, directly matching the code's definition of making producers responsible for the post-consumer stage.
- **LLM Citations:**

#### 📍 Country: Ghana
- **LLM Coded:** `1`
- **NVIVO Coded:** `0`
- **LLM Reasoning:**
> The document explicitly proposes a fee on polymer producers to fund the end-of-life management of their products, which is the core mechanism of an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme. The text directly frames this as 'extending the responsibility of producers to pay for the costs of pollution' and mentions the potential role of 'producer responsibility organizations,' which are common in EPR systems.
- **LLM Citations:**
> - To raise sufficient funds, Ghana proposes that the legally binding instrument include a Global Plastic Pollution Fee (GPPF), as one of the tools to operationalise the “polluter pays principle”.
> - The GPPF would hold polymer producers accountable for the pollution costs of all their plastics, irrespective of the country where the plastics end their useful life, and of whether the plastics are ultimately destined for recycling or disposal.
> - A GPPF offers an international solution to this transboundary problem, extending the responsibility of producers to pay for the costs of pollution.
> - For other aspects, Ghana is considering further the potential role of entities such as the Global Environment Fund or development banks; producer responsibility organizations; or other entities, possibly newly created.

- **LLM Reasoning:**
> The document strongly advocates for the inclusion of targets within the future international instrument. For example, it states that 'Parties should adopt legally binding targets to restrain plastic production and consumption' and that measures could be 'underpinned by targets, for example for the reduction of avoidable plastic waste and the recycling of plastic waste'. However, the document does not mention any specific, measurable targets with concrete numbers, percentages, or deadlines. It only proposes the concept and types of targets that should be considered.

- **LLM Reasoning:**
> The document does not contain any specific, measurable, or time-bound targets. Instead, it proposes that targets should be established in the future. The citations show this by using non-specific language such as 'to an agreed level to reach a common target' and stating that 'Parties should set a target', rather than defining what those targets are.
- **LLM Citations:**
> - General obligation: each Party should be required to take effective measures, in alignment with the World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments and other obligations under international agreements wherever required, to reduce the production of plastics polymers to an agreed level to reach a common target.
> - Parties should set a target for reducing the generation of plastic waste in need of final disposal operations such as landfilling and burning.

# LLM-automated review of mentioned-with-time-frame (test)
**Main Issues Identified**

1. **Ambiguous Definition of timeframe_specified**

The current definition asks the model to look for a "specific year, date, or timeline." This has led to a key disagreement:

The LLM's Interpretation: The LLM correctly identifies any mention of a timeline, such as Gabon's "ten-year plan" or the United Kingdom's reference to a "time-bound commitment." While literally correct, these are not specific end-dates for the overarching goal.

The Likely NVIVO Interpretation: The human coders appear to have only coded for a specific calendar year target for achieving the primary objective (e.g., "by 2040"). They correctly excluded vague or procedural references to timelines that don't set a concrete deadline for ending plastic pollution itself.

This ambiguity causes the LLM to produce false positives for the timeframe_specified code.

2. **Lack of Contextual Exclusion for mentioned**

The prompt instructs the model to search for keywords like 'addressing', 'tackling', and 'combating'. However, many of the documents are structured as direct responses to a set of questions, one of which is: “What core obligations...would provide a comprehensive approach to addressing plastic pollution...?”

The LLM's Interpretation: The LLM identifies instances where countries quote or re-state this question as evidence that they are mentioning the objective of "addressing plastic pollution." For example, the reasoning for Nigeria, Qatar, and Syria relies almost exclusively on this repeated phrase.

The Likely NVIVO Interpretation: Human coders likely recognized that repeating the framing of a question does not constitute an independent declaration of an objective. They looked for text where the country proactively states its goal, rather than just referencing the prompt it is answering.

This lack of an exclusion rule leads the LLM to generate a large number of false positives for the mentioned code when no timeframe is present.

**Suggestions for Improving Code Definitions**
To improve alignment and reduce discrepancies, the code definitions in the prompt should be refined to be more precise and context-aware.

**Revised Definition for mentioned**

Add a clarifying instruction and an exclusion rule to ensure the model distinguishes between a stated objective and a repeated question.

>mentioned (boolean): Look for explicit statements where the submission independently puts forward a primary goal or objective to end, eliminate, address, tackle, combat, prevent, or stop plastic pollution. The statement must originate as the country's own objective. Exclusion: Do not code as true if the text is merely repeating the language of a question it is responding to, such as quoting "addressing plastic pollution" from a prompt. The evidence must be a declarative statement of intent.

**Revised Definition for timeframe_specified**

Make the definition more stringent to capture only specific, overarching deadlines.

>timeframe_specified (boolean): Check if a specific calendar year (e.g., 'by 2040', 'by 2050') is mentioned as the target for achieving the main objective of ending or eliminating plastic pollution. Exclusion: Do not code as true for vague references like 'a ten-year plan', 'a time-bound commitment', or timelines for secondary or partial goals. The timeframe must apply to the overall, ultimate goal.
