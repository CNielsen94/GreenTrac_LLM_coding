Consideration can be given to similar articles under the Montreal Protocol and the Minamata Convention – specifically in the areas of a Multilateral Fund, Global Environment Facility Trust Fund, Plastic Pollution Trust fund, transfer of technologies, establishment of an Executive Committee, capacity building and technology assistance. || A global approach to identifying and managing hazardous chemicals, polymers, and products, including development of a hazard criteria. || A global statistical framework will need to be developed to ensure accurate and comparable reporting. This can be based on the System of Environmental Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA). || A mechanism for certifying adherence to sustainable design criteria (including eco-criteria) || A mechanism for reviewing and updating the criteria will be important || A minimum set of design and performance criteria must be met before materials and products can be traded, setting a level playing field for the industry. Considerations should also include the use of traditional materials into biodegradable products. || A registry of product design should be provided by the parties to the secretariat. || Adheres to the minimum elements as laid out in the agreement (possibly in an Annex that can be updated), to allow for comparability. || All parties to eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels used as raw materials and for petrochemicals destined for virgin polymer production. || An eco-criteria should be listed for plastic products that consists of both general eco-criteria (e.g., durability) and product- or sectoral-specific eco-criteria (e.g., agri-plastics in agriculture or fishing gear) || An effectiveness evaluation can be included in the agreement. || Annexes may include listings of chemicals, polymers and products that require elimination (phasing out) or reducing (phasing down) to a minimum. Listings should also include virgin plastic polymers. Specific exemptions for applications must be justified, with any hazard management requirements or end-of-life responsibilities. || Any voluntary provisions to be included in the INC negotiations must have a pathway towards mandatory provisions at an agreed post-date, based on a threshold reached or the years after entry into force of the treaty. || Criteria, standards, and definitions/terms will need to be developed. These can be included in Annexes that can be easily updated, outlining design and performance criteria. || Develop national monitoring programmes to support 1(a) and 3. Monitoring to include plastic production, plastic consumption, plastic waste management, leakage, plastic released to the environment, alternatives, and substitutes || Development of a criteria for determining which materials and products are unnecessary and avoidable. || Development of technologies to enable accurate, traceable, and easy management of HS codes by customs authorities. Build capacity at the border. || Each Party shall develop and implement a National Action Plan that: || Each Party shall develop and maintain publicly available inventories of plastic-related chemicals, polymers, and products, as well as emissions throughout the full life cycle of plastics. || Each party is required to take steps to reduce, and where feasible releases of plastics to water, land and air from the source categories listed in an annex. || Eliminate stockpiles of plastic waste through environmentally sound practices (this may require technical and financial assistance for some countries). || Establish baseline indicators and targets to monitor plastic pollution in the environment and its impacts. || Global targets to include the production and consumption of plastic polymers within sustainable levels, recycled plastics within a threshold and near-zero release of plastics to the environment (land, air, and water) by 2040. || HS codes will need revision to allow for meaningful tracking. || Have control measures to avoid green washing. This will also address any rise in alternative products driven by industry innovation that are harmful to the environment || Horizon scanning and reports generated by the subsidiary bodies could catalyse targeted research according to the needs of the COP. || Integrate plastics-related data in reporting requirements under other MEAs, such as Paris Agreement, CBD, Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, SDGs, etc. || Inventories must be designed based on minimum elements outlined in the agreement (possibly in an Annex) to enable the tracking of trends and to measure effectiveness of the agreement. || Inventories must be designed to track: Resource efficiency – material flows from the environment into the economy. Circularity – material flows within the economy (including production, import, export, and recycling). Pollution – flows from the economy into the environment. Remediation – volumes and types of legacy plastics removed from the environment. Emissions – such as losses of pre-production pellets during production, manufacture, and transport; GHG emissions related to the stages of the plastics life cycle; waste management services; landfill leachate; incineration. || Legacy plastic waste should be addressed by members of the parties through policy measures, followed by financial and legal instruments. Cooperation by members of the parties is encouraged to develop strategies to eliminate legacy plastic waste. There is legacy plastic waste beyond national jurisdictions but within the region that needs to be cleaned up through better cooperation. || Licensing scheme – Parties are to adopt a licensing scheme for production, importation, and exportation of virgin and secondary plastic polymers. || Mandate use of best practices to minimise losses of pre-production pellets, flakes and powders during production, manufacture, and transport. || Monitoring and evaluation || Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) such as the BRS Conventions address many downstream components, hence the articles of the new treaty should primarily cover sourcing, upstream and midstream stages. || National targets to include the reduction in production and consumption of plastic polymers, reduction in the release of plastics to the environment, and a minimum target for the collection and recycling of plastic waste. || Parties are required to not allow the production and use of polymers, chemicals and plastic products listed in an Annex. || Parties should ban the exportation and importation of plastic products from/to other countries that do not meet the eco-criteria || Phase out unnecessary and avoidable primary micro- and nanoplastics. || Provides a minimum period for review and strengthening of the targets, based on international timelines. || Provides baseline information for the year on which targets will be set. The baseline may be based on production, importation, and legacy waste. Marine colonial waste (washed up marine litter) should be accounted separately as it is outside national control. || Provisions for Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge Systems must be included in elements of the treaty. || Provisions on Trade controls – chemicals, polymers, products, and waste || Provisions to ensure sustainable design of materials and products and minimise production of problematic chemicals, polymers, and products towards safe, non-toxic, and transparent circularity of plastics. || Provisions to phase out the production and consumption of unnecessary and avoidable chemicals, polymers, and plastic products. || Provisions to reduce emissions and eliminate releases of plastics to the environment (water, land, and air), eliminate stockpiles and legacy plastics in the environment. || Report at regular intervals according to an agreed minimum set of elements, based on national inventories. || Reporting || Reporting to include quantities and type of polymers produced, origins of raw materials used to produce plastic polymers, quantities and type of chemicals applied in production, consumption of virgin plastic polymers, use of plastic by market segment and the management of plastic waste (collection, recycling, disposal, leakage, and trade). || Sets targets based on the internationally targets set in the agreement. || Subsidiary bodies should be established to assist with implementation of the agreement and could be determined once the substantive content of the agreement is developed... bodies to assess and synthesize available scientific information on environmental, social, and economic impacts and benefits, human health impacts, etc. || Sustainable design of products to improve stability and avoid leakage of chemicals and microplastics. || The Annex should have a list of categories that include wastewater, industrial facilities, aquaculture, agriculture and the fishing industry, and transport. || The Conference of Parties should have guidelines on the best techniques and environmental practices on how to reduce emissions and eliminate releases of plastics to the environment (water, land, and air), based on the list of categories in the Annex || The Conference of the Parties should adopt a criteria for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes || The articles and chapters of the treaty should first and foremost focus on 'mandatory' provisions with 'specific' control measures and core obligations across the full life cycle of plastics. || The criteria should identify polymers and chemical that have substances that have slow or no degradation in the environment, bioaccumulate and/or have long-term toxic effects, not recyclable and have high litter risk || These can be supported by guidelines, including for key sectors, possibly developed with input from the private sector. || These criteria should allow for national contexts. Criteria and definitions may be adopted at the national level that are stronger than the global criteria outlined in the Annexes. || This will require the development of criteria for determining which materials, polymers and products are problematic, allowing for national contexts. Criteria and definitions may be adopted at the national level that are stronger than the global criteria. || This will require the development of targets and indicators, which should also inform the design of national inventories. || Trade controls must include restrictions in trade with non-Parties of non-compliant chemicals, polymers, products, and wastes, considering the controls established by the Basel Convention, Stockholm Convention, Rotterdam Convention, etc. || Transparency is critical to ensure chemical components of the plastic products and materials are identified.","Supports the mention of measures/instruments.
