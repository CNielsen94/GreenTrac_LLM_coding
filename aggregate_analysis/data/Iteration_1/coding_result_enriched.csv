science, technology, and innovation; and awareness raising, education and exchange of information. || Each Party should be obligated to develop and communicate a national action plan that outlines how it will contribute to the achievement of the instrument's objective, including how it intends to implement obligations specified in the instrument with regard to preventing, reducing, or eliminating plastic pollution. || Educational opportunities should be geared towards enabling consumers and the public to make better decisions about plastic use and disposal, rather than just sharing resources about the impacts of plastic pollution. || Key characteristics that we believe would be integral to a successful compliance process include: * A focus on facilitating compliance; * Equal application to all Parties, with any differentiation based on the nature of obligations rather than the circumstances of the Party; * Simplicity and efficiency; and * A transparent process with ultimate decisions in the hands of Parties. || Measures to enhance the circularity of plastic, including through reuse. || Measures to foster innovation and incentivize sustainable or green chemistry to further reduce the use of hazardous substances in plastic and further the development of more sustainable alternatives to plastics. || Measures to publish and update, in a transparent manner, relevant and available information on plastic production, use, and additives, consistent with national laws. || Measures to strengthen demand for secondary plastics to facilitate environmentally sound plastic scrap recycling, including by using public procurement to drive demand for plastic products containing higher recycled content levels, where feasible. || Measures to strengthen environmentally sound management of plastic waste, including actions to prevent and reduce the generation of plastic waste. || Parties and others should be encouraged to actively promote the sharing of information on, for example, sustainable consumption and production, environmentally sound waste management, sources of plastic pollution, human and animal exposures to plastic pollution, associated risks, and reduction options, among policy makers, stakeholders, and the public. || Processes for working with stakeholders, international organizations, and others to consider product design and develop transparent labeling of plastic products that can enable informed consumer choices and facilitate reuse and recycling. || Public procurement policies or other approaches that prevent and reduce the generation of plastic waste, including from single-use plastics. || Such reporting should be done transparently to demonstrate the progress the Party is making under its plan and inform periodic assessments of the effectiveness of the instrument. || The United States believes that such reporting obligations can help shed light on the extent to which Parties are individually contributing to the achievement of the instrument's objective and complying with their obligations under the instrument. || The United States believes that, as a general matter, any national reporting requirements of the instrument should: * Be binding on all Parties; * Serve a clear purpose; * Be precise; * Be relevant to specific obligations of the instrument; * Promote transparency; * Promote accountability; * Establish a regular cycle; * Be based on readily available information (both at a global and country level); * Be broadly applicable to all Parties to ensure that sufficient data is available for the governing body to evaluate and make future decisions for the instrument; * Avoid duplicative reporting available through other multilateral environmental agreements, fora, or generally accessible global databases; and * Be manageable and not too burdensome, to avoid unduly drawing resources away from implementation of substantive provisions of the instrument. || The United States supports a reporting obligation that requires the regular provision of relevant information by Parties. || The United States supports a robust, science-based, transparent, and cost-effective effectiveness evaluation of the aggregate actions taken under the instrument that is based on consistent and reliable data. || The United States supports including a provision in the instrument establishing a compliance process, once there is further clarity with respect to the nature of the substantive obligations that Parties would undertake. || The United States supports provisions that would allow for the governing body of the instrument to establish one or more subsidiary bodies to support the governing body in specific aspects of implementation of the instrument. || The effectiveness evaluation should be a scientific and technical process (rather than a policy-making process) that relies on existing information and/or data, rather than generating new data. || The governing body of the instrument should be able to use the reporting information generated to assess the overall progress of the instrument in achieving its objective and to contribute to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the instrument. || The instrument should also promote sharing of knowledge and greater understanding of best practices, policies, and interventions to enhance Parties' efforts to address plastic pollution across the plastics lifecycle. || The instrument should have provisions on mandatory national reporting. || The instrument should have provisions to encourage Parties to promote the cooperation and coordination of research to improve understanding of plastic pollution, including, inter alia, monitoring and modeling the fate and transport of plastic in environmental compartments, environmental impacts, potential adverse human health outcomes, and the environmental, economic, and socioeconomic consequences and effectiveness of specific interventions throughout the lifecycle of plastic. || The instrument should include provisions for Parties to promote cooperation and coordination on technological innovation, including on product design, materials, and manufacturing processes; sustainable, green chemistry, and circular approaches related to plastics; and other technological advancements for environmentally sustainable and cost-effective approaches to address plastic pollution at local, regional, and global scales. || The instrument should obligate Parties to update their respective plans regularly (e.g., every five years). || The primary goal for a compliance process is to ensure that it promotes the effectiveness of the instrument, including the achievement of its objective. || The scale of the evaluation should be global and focus on the effectiveness of aggregate actions under the instrument to achieve the objective. || These might address a range of areas, including, among other things, improving product design, ecolabeling, public procurement, recycled content levels in plastic products, the management of plastic waste, and programs to incentivize recycling and reuse (e.g., extended producer responsibility approaches). || This should also include improving the understanding of production and consumption of plastic, including, inter alia, lifecycle analysis of plastics and their alternatives, and the circularity of plastic. || Where possible, activities undertaken should have demonstrated evidence of success in preventing and reducing plastic pollution and could include consumer behavior change campaigns, training, education, public awareness, public participation, and public access to information. || Where possible, such aspects could include a standardized format for reporting and a set of harmonized methodologies and measurements, metrics, and indicators to measure progress under the instrument, as well as progress in the implementation of national action plans, building on existing data collection activities. || With regards to national action plans, the United States supports an obligation for each Party to report on the progress achieved on implementation of all elements of its national action plan, including progress towards achieving any goals or targets set out in the plan.","This is a proposed measure.
