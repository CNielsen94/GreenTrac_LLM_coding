Location: ## Additional input,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cambodia has developed and implemented several measures focusing on 4R (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) actions to reduce plastic waste generation and to prevent both land- and sea-based plastic leakages || Control measures: We propose the following control measures: • Controlling and reducing the overall global plastic production, • Bans on the production and trade of harmful substances and additives, • EPR obligations for global multi-national corporates which produce oil and plastics to support low-and middle-income countries in achieving effective collection and recycling of plastic waste, and • Bans and enforcement of prohibition on illegal trade, dumping, and disposal of plastic waste. || Core obligations: We support core obligations including: 1) Phasing out non-essential plastics including single-use plastics, 2) Bans and elimination of non-economically recyclable plastic items, harmful substances and additives, 3) Making other plastics reusable and recyclable along with product standards/labelling, 4) Promote the use of biodegradable and compostable products to replace plastic, 5) Promotion/adaption of circular measures (e. g. environmentally friendly alternatives, recycling, reuse, repair of plastics), 6) Bans and enforcement of illegal trade, dumping, and disposal of plastic waste, and 7) Environmentally sound management of plastic waste including legacy waste. || Due to limited capacity and finance for data collection and management, technical and financial support is required for low- and middle-income countries to be able to collect baseline data on plastic pollution (types of plastics generated, pollution sources, status of treatments) and to build adequate capacity for M&E, monitoring and reporting. || Enabling policies and regulations for 4Rs, including draft National Action Plan & National Roadmap for plastic management, a draft sub decree on plastic management, and policy matrix || Environmental education and awareness raising: The measures mentioned above will be effective only when adopted and implemented by target stakeholders (e. g. citizens, businesses, informal sector). This requires enhancing the knowledge of problems and solutions for plastic pollution. Systemic efforts are also required in support of behavior change. || Environmental education and awareness raising: This includes dissemination of 100+ videos, strategic social media-based communication, and clean-up and outreach activities to schools, communities, and temples, with a reach of more than 2 million students and people in Cambodia || Equally important is to provide technical and financial support to low- and middle-income countries in enhancing collection and management capacities of plastic waste and legacy plastics. || Further research, knowledge, and technology transfer are needed in the following areas • Scientific evidence on the impacts of micro-plastics on our environment and human health • Clear definitions and guidelines for environmentally friendly alternatives (unclarity remains about environmentally friendly alternatives, bioplastics, biodegradable and compostable plastics) • Best practices to engage the private sector, for innovation, finance and investments, sustainable production and consumption, EPR schemes, plastic credit schemes, etc. • Plastic credit schemes: What is the role of the emerging, voluntary plastic credit scheme under the ILBI? • Best practices to engage the informal sector into CE measures to meet lifestyle interests and aspirations while also providing social and economic security, • Research and development of bioplastic technology and investment in bioplastic production, • Capacity building and fellowship/internship in the field of biodegradable and compostable plastic management and circular economy. || In addition to finance, transfer of technology and knowledge, and institutional capacity building are another enabling factor for the leased developed and developing countries to promote environmentally sound management of plastic waste (e. g. plastic recycling, plastic waste into bricks/asphalt production, waste to energy) and providing environmentally friendly alternatives and circular solutions. || Innovation, finance, and business development for alternatives (such as bioplastics/compostable plastics), and Circular Economy solutions (recycling, reuse, plastic waste to energy, bricks, and asphalt production). Cambodia is also in the process of designing a voluntary Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme to mobilize technical and financial support to ensure effective collection and treatment of plastic waste || Lastly, while many innovative solutions are emerging (e. g. environmentally friendly alternatives, plastic recycling, mixing plastic waste into bricks and asphalt production, waste to energy), there is limited knowledge about the feasibility of business models, their possible environmental impacts, and appropriate environmental standards. || Measures to foster private sector engagement: the private sector plays a pivotal role in fostering innovation in product design, technology and production, and mobilizing required finances/investments for resource efficient production, and effective collection and treatment of plastic waste. || NAPs should also entail clear plans for M&E and reporting to track and report the progress and results towards the set goals with references to linkages to the NDC GHG targets (waste sector). || Policy, regulatory, fiscal, and economic measures (led by national and subnational governments): Besides NAP, a range of policy and regulatory instruments shall be required such as regulations on single-use plastics, standards for recycling operations, green procurement, and eco-labeling. Fiscal and economic measures are also essential to deter environmentally harmful plastic materials/products and to promote environmentally friendly alternatives and CE measures. || Similar to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) used under the Paris Agreement, National Action Plans (NAPs) shall be used as a key policy instrument for countries to outline national commitments, goals, and proposed sets of measures to contribute to both national and global goals to end land-and sea- based plastic pollution. || Support for innovation, finance, and technology: Financial and technical assistance is needed for low- and middle-income countries in implementing the obligations of the ILBI. || Various instruments (regulations, levies, taxes, subsidies, EPR schemes) can be used to promote environmentally friendly products and practices, and to deter the production and sale of hazardous/non-essential plastic materials/products. || Voluntary approaches.
