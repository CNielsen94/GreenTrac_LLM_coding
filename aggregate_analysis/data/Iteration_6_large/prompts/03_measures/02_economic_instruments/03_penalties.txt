- `details` (string): List specific penalty mechanisms mentioned, such as 'fines for improper disposal', 'fees for excessive packaging', 'polluter-pays schemes', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.
