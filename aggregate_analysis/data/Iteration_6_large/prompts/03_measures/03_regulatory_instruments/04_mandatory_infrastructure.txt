You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the regulatory instrument of mandatory infrastructure, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

---
### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for mentions of required infrastructure development, facility establishment, or system creation to implement the treaty provisions, especially for waste collection and recycling. This does not include mentions of National Action Plans (NAPs) and their proposed contents. Only include explicit mentions of mandatory infrastructure, not implied needs of mandatory infrastructure.
- `details` (string): List specific infrastructure requirements mentioned, such as 'separate collection systems', 'recycling facility requirements', 'waste sorting infrastructure', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json
{
  "measures": {
    "regulatory_instruments": {
      "mandatory_infrastructure": {
        "mentioned": "boolean",
        "details": "string | null",
        "citation": [
          "string"
        ],
        "reasoning": "string | null"
      }
    }
  }
}
