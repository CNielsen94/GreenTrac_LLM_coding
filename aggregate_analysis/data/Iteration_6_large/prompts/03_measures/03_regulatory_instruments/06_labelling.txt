You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the regulatory instrument of mandatory labelling, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

---
### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for mentions of required product labels, marking, or information disclosure about plastic composition, recyclability, proper disposal, or environmental impact. Only include explicit mentions of mandatory labelling, not implied needs of labelling or voluntary labelling.
- `details` (string): List specific labeling requirements mentioned, such as 'recyclability labels', 'plastic content disclosure', 'disposal instruction requirements', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json

  "measures": {
    "regulatory_instruments": {
      "labelling": {
        "mentioned": "boolean",
        "details": "string | null",
        "citation": [
          "string"
        ],
        "reasoning": "string | null"
      }
