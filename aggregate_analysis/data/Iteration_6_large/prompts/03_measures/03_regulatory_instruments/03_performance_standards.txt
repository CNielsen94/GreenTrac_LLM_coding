You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the regulatory instrument of performance standards, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

---
### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for product or material standards, specifications, criteria, requirements, or regulations that products must meet, including recyclability or durability standards. Performance standards must not simply be implied through other measures - they must be stated as stand-alone measures.
- `details` (string): List specific standards mentioned, such as 'minimum recyclability requirements', 'durability standards for plastic products', 'packaging design criteria', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json
{
  "measures": {
    "regulatory_instruments": {
      "performance_standards": {
        "mentioned": "boolean",
        "details": "string | null",
        "citation": [
          "string"
        ],
        "reasoning": "string | null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
