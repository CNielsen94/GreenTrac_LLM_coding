You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the regulatory instrument of trade requirements, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for mentions of international trade-related measures linking to plastics or plastic products, such as import/export restrictions, quotas, or notification requirements. The document must advocate a measure in order to constitute a mention. Do not include mentions of other international conventions in relation to trade measures.
- `details` (string): List specific trade requirements mentioned, such as 'plastic waste export restrictions', 'import controls on certain polymers', 'notification for hazardous plastic trade', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your decision. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
