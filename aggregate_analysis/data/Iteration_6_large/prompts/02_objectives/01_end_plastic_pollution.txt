You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the objective of ending plastic pollution, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definition** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches the definition.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object. Do NOT include any other text or explanations.

### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for explicit statements about ending, eliminating, addressing, tackling, combating, preventing, or stopping plastic pollution as a primary goal or objective. Search for phrases like 'end plastic pollution', 'address plastic pollution', 'tackle the plastic crisis', etc.
- `timeframe_specified` (boolean): Check if there is a specific year, date, or timeline mentioned for when plastic pollution should be eliminated or significantly reduced. Look for phrases like 'by 2030', 'by 2040', 'within X years'.
- `timeframe` (string): If a timeframe is specified, capture the exact time target mentioned (e.g., 'by 2040', 'within 10 years', '2030-2050').
- `citation` (list of strings): **Extract a list of direct quotes** from the text that support your overall decision for this code. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain how the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
