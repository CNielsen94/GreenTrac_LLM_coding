You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to any mentioned benefits of plastics, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Search for acknowledgments of plastic's positive contributions, utility, or necessity in certain contexts. This may include statements about why some plastic use should continue or references to essential uses.
- `benefits_listed` (string): Capture any specific benefits or essential uses mentioned, such as 'medical applications', 'food preservation', 'transportation safety', etc.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your overall decision for this code. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json
{
  "objectives": {
    "benefits_of_plastics": {
      "mentioned": "boolean",
      "benefits_listed": "string | null",
      "citation": [
        "string"
      ],
      "reasoning": "string | null"
    }
  }
}
