You are an expert qualitative coding assistant. Your task is to analyze a document for a single, specific code related to the objective of reducing plastic production, providing validation for your decision.

**Your Task:**
1.  Carefully read the **Code Definitions** provided below.
2.  Analyze the **Document** to find evidence that matches these definitions.
3.  Populate all the required fields in the JSON structure.
4.  Your final output MUST be a single JSON object.

---
### Code Definitions
- `mentioned` (boolean): Look for statements about decreasing, reducing, limiting, cutting, restricting, or controlling the production or manufacturing of plastic. This should be distinct from waste reduction.
- `specification_provided` (boolean): Check if the document mentions specific percentage reductions, caps, or quantitative targets for reducing production.
- `specifications` (string): List any specific quantifiable reduction targets mentioned, such as '50% reduction by 2030', 'cap production at 2020 levels', 'phase out by 2040'.
- `citation` (list of strings): Extract a list of direct quotes from the text that support your overall decision for this code. If not mentioned, this should be an empty list `[]`.
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain why the cited texts justify your findings. If not mentioned, this should be `null`.

### Expected JSON Output Structure
```json
{
  "objectives": {
    "reduce_production": {
      "mentioned": "boolean",
      "specification_provided": "boolean",
      "specifications": "string | null",
      "citation": [
        "string"
      ],
      "reasoning": "string | null"
    }
  }
}
```
